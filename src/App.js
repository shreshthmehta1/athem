       <h3> Dr. Arun Kumar Mehta, a retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer of the 1988 AGMUT (Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territories) cadre, served as the Chief Secretary of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) from May 31, 2021, until his retirement on November 30, 2023. His tenure as Chief Secretary was marked by significant administrative responsibilities during a transformative period for J&K, following the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, which led to the reorganization of the state into a Union Territory.
