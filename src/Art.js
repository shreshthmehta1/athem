        Dr Arun Kumar Mehta — Selected Articles (2025–2026)
A curated compendium of essays that move beyond observation to diagnose structural failures in governance, environmental infrastructure, equity, and technology policy. These writings represent sustained thinking shaped by long experience in public administration, environmental regulation, and systemic reform.

<h3>Equity, Sustainability and Future readiness.</h3> 
1) Oceans of Inequity: How Technology May Divide the Last Commons
Times of India Blogs | 20 April 2025<br/>
🔗 https://share.google/AbuIscg4OGZwP31ym<br/>
Summary: Analyses how digital and sensing technologies—AI, autonomous mapping, data networks—may stratify access to ocean resources, converting the global commons into technologically gated domains. Argues for equitable governance frameworks that protect access rights, data sovereignty, and benefit-sharing.
<br/>2) Wake Up India: AI Colonialism Is Not a Myth
<br/>Moneycontrol Opinion | 6 March 2025
<br/>🔗 https://share.google/ky3VzVXlNERAByxXb
<br/>Summary: Warns that India’s dependence on imported AI chips, cloud platforms, and large language models risks creating a new dependency—“AI colonialism.” Makes the case for sovereign digital infrastructure as central to democratic autonomy, equitable growth, and strategic resilience.
Climate Governance & Environmental Limits
<br/>3) Climate Negotiations: A Process That Fails, Yet Cannot Be Abandoned
<br/>Times of India Blogs | 20 May 2025
<br/>🔗 https://share.google/L0Tju9RwpxFOgtsYP
<br/>Summary: A realistic assessment of the global climate negotiation regime—acknowledges persistent weaknesses but defends multilateralism as indispensable for common rules, accountability pressures, and shared responsibility, beyond transactional outcomes.
<br/>4) World Plastic Crisis: Awareness and Circular Economy Can Save the Day
Firstpost | April 2025
<br/>🔗 https://share.google/FklTqs2GHody3ZXHY
<br/>Summary: Traces the lifecycle failure of plastics—from convenience to persistence and toxicity—and argues that circular economy strategies must be backed by producer responsibility, infrastructure for segregation, and equity-centric policy if they are to succeed.
<h3>Air Pollution as a Governance & Infrastructure Failure</h3>
<br/>5) Clean Air: India’s Missing Infrastructure
<br/>Times of India Blogs | 23 October 2025
<br/>🔗 https://share.google/2EAnSyVf9uOVzivSb
<br/>Summary: Reframes air pollution as a system and infrastructure deficit rather than merely a behaviour or awareness problem. Argues that effective clean-air strategies require engineered systems—monitoring networks, enforcement mechanisms, and accountable institutions.
<br/>6) Delhi’s Air: The Myths That Keep Choking Us
<br/>News18 Opinion | 28 October 2025
<br/>🔗 https://www.news18.com/opinion/opinion-delhis-air-the-myths-that-keep-choking-us-ws-kl-9665926.html
<br/>Summary: Identifies persistent misconceptions (e.g., cloud seeding as panacea; seasonal inevitability) that detract from system-level action, urging policy grounded in science, monitoring, and structural change.
<br/>7) Cloud Seeding: Between Hope, Humility and the Limits of Control (with C.K. Mishra)
<br/>News18 Opinion | 3 November 2025
<br/>🔗 https://www.news18.com/opinion/opinion-cloud-seeding-between-hope-humility-and-the-limits-of-control-ws-kl-9677008.html
<br/>Summary: Provides a balanced assessment of cloud seeding—not dismissing its potential but stressing its scientific and operational constraints as well as its limits without broader emissions reductions.
<br/>8) Cleaning Delhi’s Air Requires a Delhi-Specific Plan
<br/>Indian Express Opinion | 18 December 2025
<br/>🔗 https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/cleaning-delhis-air-requires-a-delhi-specific-plan-10427736/lite/
<br/>Summary: Advocates for governance tailored to Delhi’s meteorology and airshed realities, favouring predictive planning and regional coordination over generic national frameworks or crisis responses.
<br/>January 2026: The Air Pollution Trilogy (Exposure > Optics)
<br/>9) Work From Home Is No Shield Against Toxic Air — Unless Indoor Discipline Is Followed
<br/>News18 Opinion | 3 January 2026
<br/>🔗 https://share.google/nxnwM3JHiQnjj9NQj
<br/>Summary: Challenges the assumption that indoor work automatically reduces exposure. Explains how infiltration, poor ventilation, and indoor sources can keep pollutant levels high, and proposes a practical public-health framework for indoor air discipline.
<br/>10) Dealing With Delhi’s Invisible Smog Trap
<br/>Hindustan Times Opinion | 21 January 2026
<br/>🔗 https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/dealing-with-delhi-s-invisible-smog-trap-101768922924408.html  
<br/>Summary: Highlights how early successes in pollution control give way to a more insidious phase where secondary pollutants and ‘invisible’ fine fractions dominate, calling for deeper institutional and chemical understanding rather than superficial indicators.
<br/>Hindustan Times

<br/>Times of India Blogs | January 2026
<br/>🔗 https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/blindspots-in-air-pollution-management-why-cleaner-looking-air-is-not-necessarily-healthier-air/
<br/>Summary: Exposes regulatory blindspots—over-emphasis on PM₂.₅ averages and appearance-based air quality indices—and advocates for governance that prioritises toxicity, precursor dynamics, and health outcomes above optics.
